My current project focus is Serenity, which will be a desktop front-end for the End to End Encrypted Chat App Powerline, maintained by Ben Barber at [this repo.](https://github.com/ComfyTopHat/Powerline)

Powerline runs on a Python API, and the current Android App is running with Kotlin. 

Serenity is largely just a front end executable to run on desktop. It started life as a Laravel Web-app called Outlet but was eventually swapped over to C# after it was concluded a web-app would most likely be unnecessary.

Fiftybit was an experiment I built to build a social media forum aping off a certain website I used a lot as a teenager which was famous (At least at first) for having a totally open API and encouraging users to build custom third party front-ends for it.

The idea was to build a website that was totally agnostic of its stack, which is to say, the forum, its user creation, its login, its posts, its rating system all its functions were built to be usable entirely as JSON input output on the API endpoints. And as an experiment I would call it a complete success.

React and Apache/PHP might seem like a really bizarre stack, and it really was, it would've been way easier to use Node.js and Express to host the API and that would've played much nicer with React JSX. But what I was trying to demonstrate (to myself more than anybody) was that a front-end and a back-end can be completely agnostic of each other and I did this by having two completely separate scripting languages handling both parts of it.

## LoginSystemAlpha

### Stack: Python

Major project for my Python Certification. Nothing really that impressive just a native python app with a custom UI to handle a prototype login and logout system, writing usernames to a storage JSON and reading dynamically from it.

## E-Trading Post

### Stack: XAMMP

E-Trading post is one of my very oldest projects and is probably the first of my actual dynamic web-apps I built. It's an Ebay/Gumtree platform with user creation, login logout, and posting. Very simple and quite ugly looking but it is an entirely native PHP site using Apache and MySQL/MariaDB
